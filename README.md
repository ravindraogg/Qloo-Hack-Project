## üß† Qloo API Integration

VibeCraft leverages Qloo's Taste Intelligence API for cultural preference analysis:

### Search Endpoint
```javascript
GET https://hackathon.api.qloo.com/search
Headers: {
  "X-Api-Key": "QLOO_API_KEY",
  "accept": "application/json"
}
Parameters: {
  query: "user_input",
  limit: 10
}
```

**Purpose:** Identify relevant entities (places, brands, entertainment) from user input.

### Insights Endpoint
```javascript
POST https://hackathon.api.qloo.com/v2/insights
Headers: {
  "X-Api-Key": "QLOO_API_KEY",
  "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
Body: {
  "filter.type": "urn:entity:place|restaurant|movie|brand",
  "signal.interests.entities": "comma_separated_entity_ids",
  "limit": 8
}
```

**Purpose:** Generate targeted recommendations based on identified entities and user preferences.

### Entity Categorization Strategy
The system intelligently categorizes Qloo entities:
- **Places**: Locations and travel destinations
- **Brands**: Fashion and lifestyle brands
- **Entertainment**: Movies, TV shows, music
- **Food**: Restaurants and culinary experiences

## ü§ñ Google Gemini Prompt Engineering

### Enhanced Vibe Generation Prompt

When Qloo recommendations are available:

```
Create a compelling lifestyle vibe based on the user's request: "${input}"

Here are some relevant places/brands for inspiration (use selectively, don't force all):
${formattedRecommendations}

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Create a cohesive lifestyle experience that genuinely matches "${input}"
- Only include travel destinations that make sense for the vibe (no schools, training centers, hospitals)
- Focus on creating an aspirational but authentic experience
- Use the provided recommendations as inspiration, not mandatory inclusions
- If the input is about a mood/feeling, create recommendations that enhance that mood
- Make the description engaging and experiential

Return ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:
{
  "title": "A [descriptive] [input-based] Experience",
  "mood": "[mood that captures the essence of the input]",
  "description": "[engaging 2-3 sentence description of the experience]",
  "music": ["genre or artist that fits the vibe", "another music recommendation", "third recommendation"],
  "food": ["food that fits the experience", "another food recommendation", "third food recommendation"],
  "fashion": ["fashion style that matches", "another fashion element", "third fashion element"],
  "travel": ["meaningful travel destination 1", "meaningful travel destination 2", "meaningful travel destination 3"],
  "decor": ["decor style 1", "decor style 2", "decor style 3"],
  "colors": ["#hexcolor1", "#hexcolor2", "#hexcolor3"],
  "imageUrls": ["placeholder1", "placeholder2", "placeholder3"],
  "categories": ["category1", "category2"],
  "icons": {"music": "Music", "food": "Utensils", "fashion": "Shirt", "travel": "MapPin", "decor": "Home"}
}
```

### Fallback Prompt (No Qloo Recommendations)

```
Create an authentic lifestyle vibe based on: "${input}"

Focus on creating a genuine experience that someone would actually want to have. Think about:
- What mood does "${input}" evoke?
- What activities, places, music, food would enhance this mood?
- What would make this experience memorable and shareable?

Return ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:
{
  "title": "A [descriptive] ${input} Experience", 
  "mood": "[authentic mood based on input]",
  "description": "[compelling 2-3 sentence description]",
  "music": ["music genre/artist 1", "music genre/artist 2", "music genre/artist 3"],
  "food": ["food recommendation 1", "food recommendation 2", "food recommendation 3"],
  "fashion": ["fashion element 1", "fashion element 2", "fashion element 3"],
  "travel": ["travel destination 1", "travel destination 2", "travel destination 3"],
  "decor": ["decor style 1", "decor style 2", "decor style 3"], 
  "colors": ["#hexcolor1", "#hexcolor2", "#hexcolor3"],
  "imageUrls": ["placeholder1", "placeholder2", "placeholder3"],
  "categories": ["relevant category 1", "relevant category 2"],
  "icons": {"music": "Music", "food": "Utensils", "fashion": "Shirt", "travel": "MapPin", "decor": "Home"}
}
```

### Intent Detection Logic

The system analyzes user input to determine primary intent:

```javascript
const inputLower = input.toLowerCase();
let primaryIntent = "general";

if (inputLower.includes("travel") || inputLower.includes("vacation") || inputLower.includes("trip")) {
  primaryIntent = "travel";
} else if (inputLower.includes("food") || inputLower.includes("restaurant") || inputLower.includes("eat")) {
  primaryIntent = "food";
} else if (inputLower.includes("music") || inputLower.includes("concert") || inputLower.includes("song")) {
  primaryIntent = "entertainment";
} else if (inputLower.includes("shop") || inputLower.includes("buy") || inputLower.includes("brand")) {
  primaryIntent = "shopping";
}
```
